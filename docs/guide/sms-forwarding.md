# SMS Forwarding for 2FA

Some connectors require two-factor authentication via SMS. To enable automatic authentication, you need to set up SMS forwarding.

## Overview

The SMS forwarding setup allows ynab-connect to receive 2FA codes sent to your phone automatically. When a connector requires a 2FA code, it will wait for the code to be forwarded to the application.

## Requirements

- A smartphone (iOS or Android)
- Access to SMS messages
- A method to forward SMS to the ynab-connect server

## Setup Instructions

Documentation for setting up SMS forwarding will be added here.
